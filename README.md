The primary objective of this analysis is to determine actionable insights that can help Target Brazil boost its sales performance, enhance customer targeting, and reduce delay in order delivery. By using data-driven insights, Target can make decisions to strengthen its market position in Brazil's competitive retail market.

# Insights Deep-Dive
## Sales Performance Over Time
There has been an overall growth in sales by 14% from the years 2017 to 2018.

Sales are seasonal, with increased spikes during the Christmas and Black Friday season.

Most orders are made on weekdays between time intervals of 12:00 AM to 12:00 PM, meaning that there is a need for certain weekday (afternoon or evening) reminders to prompt the customers into making purchases.

The average order value is $161 and the average products ordered in the same order are 1 product, indicating there could be promotions to convince the customers to buy more products in the same order.

## Customer Segmentation
Customer retention rate is 10% indicating that efforts must be focused on recommendation algorithms to make the same customers buy more often.

The most successful and recent purchasers contribute 20% of the total number of orders made, while the most frequent consumers are as much as 10%, indicating the need to target our highest customers in order to provide additional income.

## Order Shipment Performance
96% is the on-time delivery rate, which indicates the order delivery wait time expectations are being highly met.

It has been documented during the analysis that on average it would take about 12 days for the order to arrive from the date of purchase, highlighting that there is a scope for improvement so that the time it takes for the order to arrive could be reduced.

# Recommendations

## Period Targeting
Invest in targeted marketing campaigns during busy seasons such as Black Friday and Christmas to maximize sales.

Targeted product recommendation alerts during weekdays in the afternoon and evening hours to encourage customers to add items to their carts or wish lists.

Insert promotions or discounts that encourage purchasing a few items for an order.

## Target High-Value Customers
Develop tailored offers and loyalty programs to retain high-value customers.

Improve the recommendation engine to make the consumers purchase more frequently.The majority of the orders are made via credit cards, which would be beneficial for the company to provide offers for credit card customers to increase the frequency of the payment made via credit cards.

## Optimize Regional Strategies

Invest further in the East region to maintain growth.

Explore opportunities in other regions with tailor-made marketing strategies to create growth there as well.

## Revitalize Underperforming Categories
Conduct market study to recognize declining sales in markets like hygiene items.

We could consider price fluctuation or the bundling options to enhance the performance.

## Reduce Waiting time
We can reduce the days taken to deliver the order by determining the areas from where orders are placed most frequently, to reduce the number of days taken to deliver the order, hire additional drivers in an attempt to allocate some of them to high order volume areas and optimal geographical routes that do not go through traffic or routes subject to closure due to accidents.

We can also try to push the average days to approve an order to zero, by fixing the root cause of the delays of getting them approved and put measures in place to reduce them.

# Assumptions and Caveats
The analysis keeps in mind that this is based on the available time frame from 2016-2018 so the trends have varied over time. 

The data isn't complete as the data for the year 2016 is almost non-existent and for the year 2018 only the data up to the 9th month is captured. 

This analysis is focused on the Brazilian target, so these insights will differ from a region to another depending on the behavior of the target customers.
